Flapp Bird is a game in which a block navigates through space with barriers to reach the other end collecting the maximum amount of stars while minimizing the number of keystrokes.

## Usage

To run the genetic Algorithm, use :
`node index.js`

To play the game, use :
`cd game`
`node game.js`

## Game Rules

The player can take 2 actions : go up or down.
